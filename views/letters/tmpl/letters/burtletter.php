<p>To the parents, guardians, and sponsors of senior high youth,</p>
<p>Greetings! I hope you're as excited as we are about our upcoming week
   at Trout Lodge. In our program that we call &quot;Burt,&quot; we
   create a community where we love and support everyone no matter what,
   where we become courageous, responsible, discover ourselves, make
   life-long friends, and have a ton of fun!</p>
<p>Our traditional Burt programming will be back this year: daily small
   groups we call &quot;touch groups,&quot; incredible nightly youth-led
   worship services, counselor-led workshops, a high ropes and tower
   climbing course, our annual parent-sponsor ice cream social, and much
   more. On Thursday, Burtoids will star in the camp's nightly vespers
   service, which is an early-evening worship service for all ages.
   We'll participate in an intergenerational carnival on Friday and
   present some fun activities to raise money for Erika Flores, a
   Nicaraguan teen whose schooling since 2010 has been sponsored by the
   Burt youth! In hours between Burt programming, our Burtoids can
   participate in just about all the activities that adult campers can,
   including Morning Celebration, kayaking, swimming, archery, horseback
   riding...</p>
<p>
   At camp on Sunday night, before the camp-wide opening, there will be
   a Parent/Guardian/Sponsor meeting. This will be held <strong>in the
      Pavilion</strong> (new location) at 7:10. Please come to meet our
   great counselors, learn your youth's schedule, ask questions, and be
   invited to the ice cream social! During the week, we'll write updates
   on all things Burt in the MUUSA Muse, the daily camp newsletter.
</p>
<p>
   My name is Abe Marsh, and I am the coordinator for the program this
   year. This will be my first year running the show, but I should add
   that I feel lucky to have three former coordinators on our counselor
   staff! We're going to explore questions that center around how we can
   make a difference in the world around us! Also new are our fantastic
   Senior High representatives to the MUUSA Planning Council, <strong>Lizz
      Elliot</strong> and <strong>Andrew Peck</strong>, who are a
   fantastic help to us as we plan the week. Also, our youth worship
   coordinators for this summer are <strong>Heather Pechtl</strong> and
   <strong>Lia Frykman</strong>. <i>These senior high, youth-led worship
      services are very powerful, and also rather late</i>. While we've
   worked to start and finish them earlier, they still start near
   midnight. This is a schedule a lot of teenagers tend to be on
   anyways, and we are careful to schedule so the youth can sleep in in
   the mornings and get, if they choose, a full night's rest. There are
   two exceptions: Tuesday, where we'll have a shorter worship the night
   before, get up early for our ropes course, and then have time to nap
   that afternoon. Also, your youth will probably get very little sleep
   Friday night, the last night of camp. They will probably crash once
   they leave camp Saturday, and <font color="indianred">SHOULD NOT PLAN
      ON DRIVING THEMSELVES</font> unless they have a chance to sleep
   first.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Another thing you should know</strong> is there is an
   unofficial tradition to dress in "outrageous," provocative costumes
   for the Wednesday evening dance. After a lot of discussion, we've
   come to call it, simply, "<strong>Costume Night</strong>." While
   everyone must keep fully covered, traditionally the youth wear short
   skirts, cross-dress, and do whatever else they can think of to look
   "scandalous." Over the years, we've come to understand the dressing
   up as something the youth see as silly, fun, and - at its deepest -
   an outgrowth of the attitude at Burt that one's appearance shouldn't
   affect whether or not one is treated with respect.
</p>
<p>
   A couple items for your youth to bring are: most importantly, <i>closed-toe
      shoes</i> for the ropes course, <i>a swimsuit</i>, <i>sunscreen</i>,
   bug spray for those who don't like being eaten, and of course
   boatloads of fearlessness and team spirit. New this year, we are
   asking everyone to bring <i>a few old t-shirts</i> for some great
   workshop and painting opportunities.
</p>
<p>
   For everyone's safety, before your youth may participate in the
   program, we must have one copy for each youth of the enclosed forms
   fully completed. Each youth must read, sign, and abide by the Burt
   rules, and the parent or guardian should complete and sign the
   Medical Information and Waiver. <strong>Please bring them to camp</strong>!
   If you will not be coming to camp with your youth, your youth will
   need an adult sponsor who will be at camp. The sponsor, in addition
   to being someone your youth can check in with over the course of the
   week, will also act as your surrogate in case of emergency or badly
   broken rules.
</p>
<p>We look forward to seeing you all again or meeting you for the first
   time. Please don't hesitate to call or e-mail for any reason. We are
   excited already imagining that first night at camp!</p>
<p>Many thanks,</p>
