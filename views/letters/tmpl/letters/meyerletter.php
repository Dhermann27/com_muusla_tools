<p>Hello Meyerites, Parents, Guardians, and Sponsors!</p>
<p>Welcome, new campers, and welcome back returning Meyerites! We are
   looking forward to another amazing week of MUUSA with all of you.</p>
<p>In 2014, we will be working with the senior high program on a service
   project for our generous hosts at Trout Lodge. We're changing up our
   activities for this year, so campers can look forward to pirate
   pontoons and mudcaving! Additionally, we will be working on a project
   to present during morning celebration, so bring your creativity as we
   work together to represent our community to the rest of MUUSA.</p>
<p>We will still reside in Camp Lakewood, so please bring some good
   (closed-toe) shoes for walking between Trout Lodge and Camp Lakewood.
   Plus, you gotta have some solid kicks for games and some old clothes
   for slogging through the mudcave. Don't forget to bring something fun
   for the dance too, whether it's funny, fancy, or in between.</p>
<p>We will bring our A-team of counselors, with a wide array of
   specialized skills and backgrounds to make this week a success,
   whether that means explaining the finer points of silent football at
   1:00am or crafting an easy bake oven from cardboard and aluminum
   foil. Your counselors will stay up with you at night and wake you up
   every morning, preferably with loud singing. They will monitor your
   fun levels and keep them at a healthy level. They'll offer learning
   experiences, from bonding in soul groups to workshops investigating
   social justice topics, sciences, arts, and language.</p>
<p>As always in the Meyer program, we seek to explore limits safely. The
   freedom to swear must be balanced by an understanding of how to use
   language without being derogatory or making others uncomfortable. The
   freedom to stay up late must be balanced by an understanding of the
   importance of sleep to health and enjoyment. The freedom to fall
   asleep in a co-ed environment must be balanced by counselor
   supervision and camper maturity. With these opportunities to safely
   explore limits, we hope that by the end of the week, all Meyerites
   will walk away feeling more confident, comfortable, and with new
   friendships to nourish and grow over their lifetime.</p>
<p>So, Meyerites, air out those swimsuits, dust off those summer
   clothes, and prepare for, most definitely, the best Meyer program
   EVER! Who Rules 2014?! Meyer Rules 2014!</p>

   <strong>A note about electronics, We strongly encourage you to leave
      anything you care about at home or in your parent/sponsor's room
      since we can't guarantee they'll be safe. You'll be so busy doing
      other cool stuff you won't have time to use them anyway!</strong>
