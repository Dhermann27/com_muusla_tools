<p>Dear Parent(s) or Guardians:</p>
<p>The Children's staff is very excited about your child(ren) coming to
   this year's Midwest UU Summer Assembly. We offer a safe and fun
   environment where your children can enjoy the week with old and new
   friends. We look forward to welcoming veteran campers and new campers
   alike.</p>
<p>Kathryn Lukow and Tabitha Rasmussen serve as co-directors of the
   program this year. Tabitha has been attending camp with her two
   daughters, now ages 11 &amp; 14, for 12 years. She has worked in the
   children's program all of those years. At home she is busy as a
   mother and an orchestra teacher with 15 years of experience. Kathryn
   has been coming to MUUSA for seven years and has worked in the
   children's program all those years. She has an Early-Childhood degree
   and has 29 years experience in education. As directors we facilitate
   the administrative planning and hire caring, experienced adults to
   work with the children. We work in conjunction with Trout Lodge staff
   to provide programming. We are excited to make the MUUSA 2014 Kid's
   Camp every bit as memorable and enjoyable as years prior.</p>
<p>We hope this letter will answer many of your questions regarding what
   to bring to Summer Assembly, what activities we have planned for your
   children, what our program guidelines include and how to reach us. We
   encourage you to call us if you have any questions and look forward
   to seeing you at Trout Lodge!</p>
<p>Please sign and bring to camp a medical release form and program
   policies for each child. Special needs can be arranged by contacting
   us directly.</p>
